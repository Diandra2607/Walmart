# Background
Walmart Inc. is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets (also called supercenters), discount department stores, and grocery stores in the United States and 23 other countries. It is headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas. As of October 31, 2022, Walmart has 10,586 stores and clubs in 24 countries, operating under 46 different names. Walmart is the world's largest company by revenue, according to the Fortune Global 500 list in October 2022. 

# Data Preprocessing
The first thing to do is to do a data preprocessing. Based on the data preprocessing, there are no missing values. So, the next step is to do analysis with two-way ANOVA.

# Two Way ANOVA
The next step is to do data analysis with Two Way ANOVA. The variables which are used are age and gender towards purchase. The results can be seen as follows.

Based on the ANOVA table, here are some key points that can be interpreted:

Tested Model:
The model contains two main factors, namely Age (has 7 levels/categories) and Gender (has 2 levels, usually M/F), with Purchase as the dependent variable.

Very Small F-value and p-value (PR(>F)):

C(Age):

F-statistic: 37.626247

p-value: 6.748909e-46 (≈ 0.00000...; very small)

This means that the average Purchase is significantly different between Age groups.

C(Gender):

F-statistic: 1992.524794 (much larger)

p-value: 0.000000e+00 (really close to zero)

Indicates a very significant difference in the average Purchase between Gender (male vs. female).

Significance of Both Factors:

Since the p-value for both is far below the significance threshold (usually 0.05), it can be concluded that:

Age has a significant effect on Purchase.

Gender also has a significant effect on Purchase.

Comparison of Magnitude of Influence:

From the F-statistic and sum of squares, it can be seen that Gender has a much higher F-statistic (±1992) than Age (±38). This indicates that Gender may explain more variation in Purchase than Age.

Quantitatively, the sum of squares for Gender (5.007079e+10) is also much higher than Age (5.669573e+09), so the portion of variation explained by Gender is more dominant.

# Insights
Based on the ANOVA results, here are some key insights that can be obtained:

1. Tailored Marketing Campaigns

- Separate your campaign targets for male and female customers.

- Use messaging, visuals, and product offerings that align with each segment’s preferences.

2. Product Placement & Shopping Experience

- If it’s a brick-and-mortar store, organize your store layout to make it easier for each gender to find the most relevant products.

- If it’s online, feature recommendations or highlights of products that are frequently searched for and of interest to male vs. female.

3. Special Offers

- Provide specific promotions (discounts, bundles) for products that are in high demand by a particular segment. For example, if data shows that men tend to shop for electronics, offer special offers in that category.

4. Personalize Communications

- Use different language styles for male and female marketing emails or push notifications.

- Highlight product benefits that align with gender preferences (e.g., emphasizing practicality or lifestyle aspects).

5. Gender and Age Interaction

- Consider whether age has a different effect on men vs. women. If so, you may need to target more specifically, such as:

a. Millennial female (female 26-35) vs. Millennial male (male 26-35).

b. Gen Z female (female 18-25) vs. Gen Z male (male 18-25).

- Marketing content, advertising platforms, and product offerings can be more targeted.

6. Themed Events or Promotions

- If data shows that certain age groups spend more around certain events (e.g. Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day, Father’s Day), incorporate marketing strategies that emphasize both gender differences and age preferences.
